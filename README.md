# xk-npm-lib
This nodejs repo is for storing my javascript modules and other files. 

Note:
> This package is still ==W.I.P.== So some of the modules or the packge itself may not work properly.
> I am just using this to store some of the modules/functions and css styles that I might use later.
> I also just use this for messing with new things and for practice.
> if you want to mess with this that is fine:
> If you have any ideas on what you think should be added or talked about then
> go to the discussion link below. I may not update this repo often.
